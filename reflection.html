        <li>I didn't have many difficulties with AI since I use it often and am progressively getting better at using it. The part that worked best was definitely the CSS. I didn't give it anything in particular, just to make the page look semi-nice and I feel it achieved that. I didn't use it but AI used something called a nav to group all the links more efficiently. For the CSS, I learned you can use RGBA for specific colors.</li>
